I added images of the color picker in this folder.
Images included brightness low and brightness high

Turning up the brightness caused the program to not be able to detect
the color because it could not identify the color on the screen.

If it's too bright it may hurt the code because the threshold becomes very close to the maximum.
(This is showcased with the higher brightness)

When the brightness is lower, the camera is also able to capture
a 'truer' hue of the color.

It also doesn't help that my webcam is not very clear.
