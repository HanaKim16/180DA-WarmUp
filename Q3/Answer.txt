I added images of the color picker in this folder.
Images included normal and with brightness turned up (flash)

Turning up the brightness can help the code because the colors are more detectable this way.
However, if it's too bright it may hurt the code because the threshold becomes very close to the maximum.
(This is showcased in the color picker screenshot 'Ducky with Flash')
The numbers for the flash photo are (255, 250, 66) - The range here is much higher versus without the flash: (233, 195, 23).
