Task 3

Observe how much lag is present. Are there ways to reduce the lag (e.g. reducing the frequency at
which messages are sent)? What if you could do processing on the IMU itself so that only a single
message is sent when something is recognized? What are other ways of getting around the lag, if you
have to have lag?

There is some lag when the values change. I think that because of the abundance of data transferrance, the lag occurs.
Perhaps having a local variable store more data than sending it would  mitigate the lag.
Another way would be to slow down the actions, but this would put into consideration the processing of less actions?

Task 4

Visually explore - From testing, I found that the directions correlate to an "x, y, and z" axis.
When flat, the gravity acceleration presents as 9.8 m/s^2.
When the IMU is idle, not much fluctuation occurs in the data.
